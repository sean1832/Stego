**Privacy Policy for StegoUI**
**Effective Date:** May 26, 2025

**1. Introduction**
StegoUI ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to safeguarding the privacy and security of all information processed by our application. This Privacy Policy governs all use of StegoUI in the nature of any data access, processing, storage, or transmission. By downloading, installing, or using StegoUI, you ("you," "your," or "User") acknowledge and agree to the practices described herein.

**2. Scope of This Policy**
This Policy applies solely to StegoUI, a desktop application that performs encryption and decryption operations locally on the User's device. StegoUI does **not** integrate with any online service, cloud platform, telemetry system, or third-party SDK that collects, transmits, or stores User Data.

**3. Definitions**

- **"Personal Data"** means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
- **"User Data"** means any file or content that the User explicitly opens, selects, or provides to StegoUI for the purpose of encryption or decryption.

**4. Data Collection and Access**
4.1. **Local-Only Processing.** StegoUI operates entirely on the User's local machine. Under no circumstances does StegoUI collect, harvest, or otherwise obtain Personal Data from the User's device.
4.2. **Voluntary File Access.** If the User elects to open or process a file (the "User Data") for encryption or decryption, StegoUI will read that file into volatile memory solely for the duration of the operation.

**5. Data Storage**
**5.1. User-Directed File I/O Only.** StegoUI reads **only** the files you explicitly select for encryption or decryption, loading them into volatile memory for the duration of the operation. When the operation completes, StegoUI writes the resulting encrypted or decrypted file **only** to the output path you designate. StegoUI does **not** create, cache, or retain any additional copies of your input or output files beyond these user-initiated reads and writes.

**5.2. No Other Persistent Storage.** Aside from the explicit file reads and writes described in 5.1, StegoUI does **not** write, cache, or store any User Data, metadata, or logs to disk, registry, or any other form of persistent storage. All intermediate data exists solely in memory and is securely purged immediately after use.

**6. Data Transmission**
6.1. **Offline-Only Operation.** StegoUI does not require, initiate, or permit any Internet or network connection for its core functionality. No data--neither Personal Data nor User Data--is ever transmitted, uploaded, or synchronized to any external server, cloud, or third-party service.

**7. Third-Party Components**
StegoUI does not incorporate, embed, or call any third-party analytics, advertising, or telemetry libraries. All external code dependencies are strictly limited to cryptographic libraries under permissive open-source licenses, which themselves do not implement any telemetry or data-reporting features.

**8. Changes to This Policy**
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective upon publication of the revised Policy within the application's "About" section and "Privacy" file on our github repository. Your continued use of StegoUI after such posting constitutes your acceptance of the amended terms.

---
By using StegoUI, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this Privacy Policy. StegoUI will **never** collect, transmit, or store any Personal Data--all operations occur strictly on your local device under your full control.
